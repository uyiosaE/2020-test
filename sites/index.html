				You will be making heavy use of the command line throughout this curriculum, 
				and the upcoming installations project will require you to install many different software 
				programs using the command line. Additionally, you will primarily be using Git within the

				command line on a daily basis in your career as a software developer, making it an indispensable
				 skill in your toolset.
